My name is Pawe≈Ç Bogut and I'm software developer strongly focused on Web Development.
Have solid experience in PHP development including Magento e-commerce platform.

Beside PHP I love to work with Ruby on Rails framework, which I found a great alternative
for my previous favorite frameworks Zend and Symphony2.

In 2014 I'd moved from Poland to United Kingdom.
Currently living and working in Manchester.
